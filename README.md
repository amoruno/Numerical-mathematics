# Numerical-mathematics

Here you will find some numerical mathematics and algorithms problems I solved in C. The mathematical setup of the problem is posed and the reasoning of the solution proposed. Tools on: dynamic memory allocation, structs, dynamic structs, are widely used in the solutions.

### Geometric median

Let $n, m \ge 1$ two fixed natural numbers. Given $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $q^{(j)}$ $\forall j = 0,...,m-1$, define the **geometric median** as the point $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for which it verifies $f(x) \leq f(z)$ $\forall z \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where the function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by $f(x) = \sum_{0 \leq j \leq m-1} d(x, q^{(j)})$
